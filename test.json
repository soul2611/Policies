The census 2011 reveals, that the extent of lease  in  the  country  is  around  6  per  cent.  In  the  absence  of  a  legal  provision  back-stopping  such  leasing, most of it is oral and therefore does not entitle the lessee to claim the status of a farmer  and access various benefits available fro m the government and credit institutions.",
